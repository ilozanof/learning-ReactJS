In this folder you can find different project where we deal with asynchronous behaviour in some way. The most basic scenario is when you need to make a HTTP call to another API.

> the folowing projects _redux-async-simple_ and _redux-async-saga_ are inspired in the code here: [Understanding redux-saga: From action creators to sagas](https://blog.logrocket.com/understanding-redux-saga-from-action-creators-to-sagas-2587298b5e71)


1. First, go through the _redux-async-simple_ project. It's a basic applications that shows random pics of Dogs, taken from an external API.

2. Then, go through the code in the _redux-async-saga_, which is the same implementation but making use of the _Saga_ framework. _Saga_ is aframework for dealing with side effects when working with asynchronous behaviour.
